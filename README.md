# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Early brain tumor detection holds paramount importance in early intervention and tailored treatment, significantly impacting patient outcomes and quality of life. Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing this field by enhancing detection accuracy, speed, and efficiency. ML algorithms analyze vast amounts of medical data, including brain imaging scans such as MRI and CT, to identify patterns indicative of tumors. By automating the analysis process, ML expedites diagnosis, enabling healthcare professionals to detect tumors earlier and more reliably. Moreover, ML algorithms can predict tumor behavior, assist in treatment planning, and even personalize therapies based on individual patient characteristics. Furthermore, ongoing advancements in ML algorithms and imaging technologies continue to refine brain tumor detection methods, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in neuro-oncology. In essence, the integration of machine learning into brain tumor detection not only improves diagnostic capabilities but also paves the way for more precise, patient-centered care strategies, ultimately transforming the landscape of brain tumor management.

 Over the past few days, I have dived into testing the power of different CNN architectures in detecting a person's brain tumor status based on computerised MRI scans. I have used publicly available kaggle brain tumor MRI scan datasets (https://lnkd.in/drHX_pti). I started by implementing a custom CNN as a baseline model and with curiosity of leveraging the power of transfer learning, I tested three other pre-defined CNN architectures: MobileNetV2, DenseNet169 and ResNet 50. It is amazing that all of these models achieved an accuracy of over 92% on the test set. This accuracy further improved to as high as 99.8% by creating an ensemble prediction of all the four models. An ensemble was created by stacking their predictions and using Microsoft's AutoML (FLAML) to to search for an optimised final learner. For those eager to explore further, I have attached the notebook in pdf for your use. As always, comments for enrichment are much welcomed.
